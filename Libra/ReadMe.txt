A - Rotate tank to the west and move forward
S - Rotate tank to the south and move forward
D - Rotate tank to the east and move forward
Q - Change weapon type
F1 - Enable debugger view where everything currently visible on the screen will be drawn within a physics circle (cyan circle), cosmetic circle (magenta circle).
     The relative forwards direction of each object is drawn in red, relative left in green. The goal rotation of the tank is drawn as a thin red rectangle outside
     on the border of the cosmetic radius. The goal rotation of the turret is drawn as a purple rectangle on the border of the cosmetic radius. The current turret 
     rotation is drawn as a purple line from the center of the tank, to the direction of the turret
F2 - Enable God Mode (Invulnerable to damage)
F3 - Enable No Clip Mode Ignores Physics collisiones for player

F6 - Cycle through the entities' heatmaps for a same group (Cycle through Leo, Aries and so on), when Debug is enabled. 
F7 - Cycle through the entities' heatmaps lists
F8 - Hard-reset the game, recreating the game from scratch. 
F9 - Proceeds to the next map
T - Slows down game time while being held down
P - Pauses the game
O - Renders a single game frame every time it's pressed, then pauses the game
M - Mutes the game
Esc - Pauses the game if not paused, if paused goes back to the attract screen. If in attract screen, exits the game

There were distinct moments early on with this project where I took too long to start thinking and implementing the tasks required for the assignments. 
I did not take particularly long with starting the project, but I did take a couple of extra days on the first assignment. 
The project itself is full of little bite sized puzzles, most often easy to solve. But what to do when you must solve 500 easy puzzles, 5 medium ones, and 1 hard one?
I certainly started solving the harder and part of core tasks, which were deemed more important. 
And when I finished those, I still had the “500” easy problems, and there was just no way I was going to be able to finish on time unless I pulled out some extra dedication. 
And I did, I delivered. Lesson learnt, for the remainder of the game, I started as early as I could, it’s much better to start and finish early. 
A game is never done, so time will not be wasted. 

The other big lesson I learnt was that, with ever increasingly huge projects (this is like maybe a small to medium one, but I am maintaining all the code by myself!),
the code can easily become messy and spaghetti like. It’s just too easy to pile some refactoring on future me. What should be done,
and what I started applying mid through the project was that if I felt the code was getting messy, I took a step back, refactored if needed.
But more importantly, I tried to think of all systems as top down as I could. Sometimes some code slips here and there, but it becomes incredibly easier to maintain this.
Every piece has a place.
